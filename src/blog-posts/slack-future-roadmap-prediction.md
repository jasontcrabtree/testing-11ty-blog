# meta: A prediction about Slack's Future Product Roadmap — and an Explanation about why Slack is a Business Operating System

I’m currently watching Slack’s investor video (it’s excellent!), and I swear they’re describing Slack as a **Business Operating System** — without using those words.

Video found here: [Slack’s Investor Video](https://investor.slackhq.com/home/default.aspx)

The platform that everything sits on, connecting different data sources, tools, jobs and functions? That definitely sounds like an operating system to me.

I’m writing this down today so I can look back in a few years to see if my hunch has paid off — that Slack launches a new core product based on doing non-messaging work inside Slack, with messaging as a core, enabling product extension.

With all of the investment and work they’ve put into integrating different systems to Slack, it seems like a natural extension for them that one day you’ll load Slack and go to the ‘Homepage’ and do work from within the client, rather than ever loading the underlying apps.

If I can do a multiplication calculation in a browser bar or using Mac’s Spotlight, why would I ever use a calculator? I think a similar concept could apply to Slack and the multitude of SaaS products integrated with it one day.

In general, that seems like a pretty effective strategic flywheel for them to create.

Integrate all of your collaboration, communication, productivity and workload within one core operating system? That concept sounds compelling — and like something that just gets better and better the more you invest in it, both for users, workplaces, Slack and integrated SaaS products.

**Ps.**

It’s a total coincidence that my first two blog posts are about Slack — future posts will be on a range of subjects (I’ve got a long list of post ideas about digital product design, coding, tech, careers, and a few other hard to label topics).

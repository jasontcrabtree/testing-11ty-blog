I'm so excited to welcome you to the first blog post published on my own domain.

Please come in, enjoy your stay â€” have a look around.

I never really participated in the hey-day dominance of blogging. I don't think my few posts on Medium quite count. So this will be a whole new experience.

This is a personal blog created in March 2019.

Future blog posts topics will include design, technology and long-form-thoughts on things I find interesting in humanities and society.

**Warning: Future posts WILL be full of em dashes.**

If you'd like to come along for the ride, I'd love it if you subscribed to my RSS feed or followed me on Twitter.

Thanks for visiting!

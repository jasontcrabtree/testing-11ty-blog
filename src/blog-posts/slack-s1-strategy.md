Because I'm a total nerd for business software, I just spent the last hour reading [Slack's](https://slack.com) S-1 (document detailed the public sale of their shares), which was filled today.

You can access that here: [Slack's S-1 Document](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1764925/000162828019004786/slacks-1.html)

There are a few interesting points in this S-1, particularly their decision do a direct listing, meaning they will list on the NYSE without an underwriter negotiating the sale of their shares. As far as I can tell, Slack is using the public listing as a way to create overall liquidity for their shares and shareholders and show their commitment to build a long-term business. That's opposed to more typical IPO's, which are often used primarily as a way to raise capital for growth (they have more than enough of that in the bank).
The document itself is fascinating — if you're that way inclined I'd definitely recommend checking it out. My favourite part — and the part I want to talk about now is the section titled: '**What Sets Us Apart**' on page 4.

A few quotes really stand out:

Under the heading **Customer-centricity is the fundamental tenet of our company** Slack explains _“We built our software and user interface around the real needs of human beings.”_ This shows a strong belief in the idea of building a business that focuses on its customers and people first and trusting that the financial results will take care of themselves.

From a strategic perspective, the **Growth Strategy** heading is a goldmine. I think it's worth emphasising both the bullet points they've used and the order they're listed as showing deep insight into Slack's strategic priorities.

### With some interpretation of the growth pillars they discuss, this is Slack's growth stragegy

- Improve the Slack product
- Focus on sales
- Focus on customer engagement and operations
- Work on cross-organisation Slack usage
- Build more enterprise features
- Further international expansion
- Build out their developer ecosystem
- Future tech advances (Workflow Automation, AI, Machine Learning and Search)

These bullet points highlight a focus on product development first, then product distribution, and then lastly advanced tech capabilities. I think this focus on product distribution and incremental improvements instead of relying on world-changing technological advances happening in the near-term is an interesting distinction to think about.

Of course, no discussion on a document like this is complete without acknowledging some of the flaws, pitfalls and things to work on. Slack is not profitable — and its expenses have increased relative to its (rapidly growing revenue). It also lists no fewer than Microsoft, Google and Facebook as potential future competitors. It seems Slack has a long path ahead of it, but I'm definitely interested to see how that plays out with its people and customer first strategy.

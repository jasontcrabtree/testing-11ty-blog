<p>Because I'm a total nerd for business software, I just spent the last hour reading <a href="https://slack.com">Slack's</a> S-1 (document detailed the public sale of their shares), which was filled today.</p>
<p>You can access that here: <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1764925/000162828019004786/slacks-1.html">Slack's S-1 Document</a></p>
<p>There are a few interesting points in this S-1, particularly their decision do a direct listing, meaning they will list on the NYSE without an underwriter negotiating the sale of their shares. As far as I can tell, Slack is using the public listing as a way to create overall liquidity for their shares and shareholders and show their commitment to build a long-term business. That's opposed to more typical IPO's, which are often used primarily as a way to raise capital for growth (they have more than enough of that in the bank).
The document itself is fascinating — if you're that way inclined I'd definitely recommend checking it out. My favourite part — and the part I want to talk about now is the section titled: '<strong>What Sets Us Apart</strong>' on page 4.</p>
<p>A few quotes really stand out:</p>
<p>Under the heading <strong>Customer-centricity is the fundamental tenet of our company</strong> Slack explains <em>“We built our software and user interface around the real needs of human beings.”</em> This shows a strong belief in the idea of building a business that focuses on its customers and people first and trusting that the financial results will take care of themselves.</p>
<p>From a strategic perspective, the <strong>Growth Strategy</strong> heading is a goldmine. I think it's worth emphasising both the bullet points they've used and the order they're listed as showing deep insight into Slack's strategic priorities.</p>
<h3>With some interpretation of the growth pillars they discuss, this is Slack's growth stragegy</h3>
<ul>
<li>Improve the Slack product</li>
<li>Focus on sales</li>
<li>Focus on customer engagement and operations</li>
<li>Work on cross-organisation Slack usage</li>
<li>Build more enterprise features</li>
<li>Further international expansion</li>
<li>Build out their developer ecosystem</li>
<li>Future tech advances (Workflow Automation, AI, Machine Learning and Search)</li>
</ul>
<p>These bullet points highlight a focus on product development first, then product distribution, and then lastly advanced tech capabilities. I think this focus on product distribution and incremental improvements instead of relying on world-changing technological advances happening in the near-term is an interesting distinction to think about.</p>
<p>Of course, no discussion on a document like this is complete without acknowledging some of the flaws, pitfalls and things to work on. Slack is not profitable — and its expenses have increased relative to its (rapidly growing revenue). It also lists no fewer than Microsoft, Google and Facebook as potential future competitors. It seems Slack has a long path ahead of it, but I'm definitely interested to see how that plays out with its people and customer first strategy.</p>

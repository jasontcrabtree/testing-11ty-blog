<p>One of the most consistently invigorating experiences I've had while learning to code is the joy of learning a seemingly small idea, then later learning how you can build on that initial concept in a super cool way.</p>
<p>The latest instance of this has been with CSS Variables. As a beginner, I always appreciated posts that explained concepts — so now I'm going to do that!</p>
<h2>The Basic Structure of a Webpage</h2>
<p>Imagine a basic website with pictures and words. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">HTML</a> (<em><strong>Hypertext Markup Language</strong></em>) is the coding language that creates the websites layout and underlying content. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/css">CSS</a> (<em><strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong></em>) is the coding language used to add styles to the original HTML code. It's a relatively controversial coding language, full of debates about whether it's even a real programming language. Personally, I love it because it's incredibly literal. Do you want to change the colour of something?</p>
<p><code>background-color: red</code></p>
<p>Or maybe you want to change the size of a font? Font size will do the trick.</p>
<p><code>font-size: 40px</code></p>
<p>HTML without CSS looks the same regardless of content — for Google, Twitter or this blog. CSS is (part of) what differentiates the design, style and brand of websites and products.</p>
<h2>Here's an Example of A Basic Webpage Without CSS</h2>
<p><img src="~/assets/images/css-variables/html-no-css.jpg" alt="A Basic HTML Website with no CSS Styling"></p>
<p>CSS Variables take things to a whole new level. CSS Variables store CSS values in keywords that can later be re-used as many times as you need. CSS Variables follow the same structure you might have learnt about in High School Algebra. I definitely failed High School algebra, potentially contributing to me being slow to pick up CSS Variables, but regardless — similar to Algebra, CSS Variables are assigned by associating a value with the variable name. For example, if we have a math problem such as Z = XY and we know that two of the values are X = 10, and Y = 5, then we can calculate Z as the result of X * Y. Luckily, there's less math involved in CSS Variables than that, but the general principle of storing a value is the same.</p>

<p>For example, if I had a particular colour that I wanted to use multiple times in the future, I could set that colour as a variable.</p>
<p><strong>Setting a CSS variable:</strong>
(I don't know why the blue hex code is red, I promise it's blue!)</p>

<p>Once we apply these styles, our website looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="~/assets/images/css-variables/adding-css-colors.jpg" alt="Adding some basic CSS using our CSS colour variable"></p>
<p>This concept of using the same variable, again and again as needed has been very compelling and is a technique I've started trying to use on every project. I was probably a bit slow to the Variables party (because of the previously discussed algebra issues). That aside, once I understood how it works, I've become a huge fan. <strong>Mostly because it just makes sense.</strong></p>
<h2>Area-Man Discovers Computers Capable of Math, News at 6 (<em>Sarcasm Disclaimer</em>)</h2>
<p>Today's revelation, however, <strong><em>(dramatic music)</em></strong> changes everything. While thinking about my favourite design methodology (<a href="https://spec.fm/specifics/8-pt-grid">the 8-px grid</a>), which uses multiples of 8 for spacing and layout decisions, and once again wishing I had memorised my maths times-tables all those years ago, it occurred to me — hang on. If you can set colour Variables, what else can you set?</p>
<p>And that moment is how I realised computers could do the math for me. I can set numbers to Variables. Now, all of my x8 times-tables math problems have been solved.</p>
<p>Using CSS Variables I can set the a few relevant spacing Variables, then re-use those values as I need throughout a design. This builds consistency directly into the design — and ensures a smooth transition if sizes need to be tweaked later on. It also means I can much more easily use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/calc">CSS calc()</a> to calculate values on the fly from base Variables.</p>
<h3>Setting Size Variables</h3>

<h3>Lastly, Let's Apply our Layout Styles (and add a nice font!)</h3>
<p><img src="~/assets/images/css-variables/final-layout-and-styles.jpg" alt="Using A Few CSS Variables to Layout our Page"></p>
<p>With that, we're left with something closely resembling a real website. We've used a single colour (that we can change easily, just by changing the initial variable) and we've got consistent spacing throughout the page.</p>
<p>Admittedly, while typing this out it DOES feel like I should have known all of this from the start, but it's tough to see what you don't know. But, I know now — and that's fricking cool and all that matters. Plus, now you know too! Mostly, I'm excited to see what else I can do with CSS Variables in the future.</p>

<p>I’m currently watching Slack’s investor video (it’s excellent!), and I swear they’re describing Slack as a <strong>Business Operating System</strong> — without using those words.</p>
<p>Video found here: <a href="https://investor.slackhq.com/home/default.aspx">Slack’s Investor Video</a></p>
<p>The platform that everything sits on, connecting different data sources, tools, jobs and functions? That definitely sounds like an operating system to me.</p>
<p>I’m writing this down today so I can look back in a few years to see if my hunch has paid off — that Slack launches a new core product based on doing non-messaging work inside Slack, with messaging as a core, enabling product extension.</p>
<p>With all of the investment and work they’ve put into integrating different systems to Slack, it seems like a natural extension for them that one day you’ll load Slack and go to the ‘Homepage’ and do work from within the client, rather than ever loading the underlying apps.</p>
<p>If I can do a multiplication calculation in a browser bar or using Mac’s Spotlight, why would I ever use a calculator? I think a similar concept could apply to Slack and the multitude of SaaS products integrated with it one day.</p>
<p>In general, that seems like a pretty effective strategic flywheel for them to create.</p>
<p>Integrate all of your collaboration, communication, productivity and workload within one core operating system? That concept sounds compelling — and like something that just gets better and better the more you invest in it, both for users, workplaces, Slack and integrated SaaS products.</p>
<p>—</p>
<p><strong>Ps.</strong></p>
<p>It’s a total coincidence that my first two blog posts are about Slack — future posts will be on a range of subjects (I’ve got a long list of post ideas about digital product design, coding, tech, careers, and a few other hard to label topics).</p>
